## Frontend Mentor Challenge

## Purpose 
I'm taking this challenge for improving my front-end coding skills by building real projects...Solving real-world HTML, CSS, and JavaScript challenges whilst working on professional designs. 

## Challenge
My challenge is to build out this pricing component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

My users should be able to:
* View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size.
* See a hover state on the desktop for the Sign-Up call-to-action.

## I Use
* HTML
* CSS 
* CSS-Grid
* SCSS
